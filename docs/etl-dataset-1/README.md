# ETL Dataset

The ETL Character Database is a repository of over one million images. The images are all hand-written and machine-printed. They include Arabic numerals, the Latin alphabet, Japanese characters, and other symbols. Nine datasets \(ETL-1 to ETL-9\) comprise the database. Each dataset may possess a different format and encoding from any other dataset.

The database was originally collated by the Electrotechnical Laboratory and is now provided by the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association \(AIST\).
